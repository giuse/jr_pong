### Installation
- Install `rvm` and `jruby` with `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby`
- Check everything's fine with `ruby -v` (should return `jruby` + version)
- Install prerequisite libraries (gems) with `bundle install`
- Launch the game from the main folder with `ruby jr_pong.rb`

### Remember that in Ruby:
- Variable names starting with an `@` refer to instance variables, and as such they have instance scope and visibility
- Instance variables do not need declaration, and have `nil` value until assigned otherwise
- Variable names without `@` are local to the function scope
- Variable names all in capital letters are constants
- Method `attr_reader` generates getters for the variables named in the parameters
- Method `attr_accessor` generates both getters and setters for the variables named in the parameters
- Multiple assignment is possible (es. `a,b,c=[1,2,3]; print b #=> 2`)
- Parenthesis after methods names are optional (for parameter passing)
- Column `:` in front of a name defines a symbol, sort of efficient lightweight string for fast name comparisons
- Keyword `include` means the content of the named module is "copy and pasted" in place, similarly to C inclusion of files
- "When Java is involved, always fill in the full prototype"

### TODO
- Make ball rotate either direction depending on touched wall and previous
  direction
