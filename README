### Installation
- Install `rvm` and `jruby` with `\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=jruby`
- Extract the project (you probably already have if you're reading this) into a folder, now `cd` into it (close terminal and do it again if you did it before)
- Check ruby's fine with `ruby -v` (should return `jruby` + version)
- Install prerequisite libraries (`gems`) with `bundle install`
- Launch the game from the main folder with `ruby jr_pong.rb`

### Remember that in Ruby:
- Variable names starting with an `@` refer to instance variables, and as such they have instance scope and visibility
- Instance variables do not need declaration, and have `nil` value until assigned otherwise
- Variable names without `@` are local to the function scope
- Variable names all in capital letters are constants
- Method `attr_reader` generates getters for the variables named in the parameters - respectively `attr_writer` for setters, and `attr_accessor` for both
- Multiple assignment is possible (es. `a,b,c=[1,2,3]; print b #=> 2`)
- Parenthesis after methods names are optional (both method declaration and calling with parameters)
- Column `:` in front of a name defines a symbol, see it as a sort of efficient lightweight string for fast name comparisons
- Keyword `include` means the content of the named module is "copy and pasted" in place, similarly to C inclusion of files
- "When Java is involved, always fill in the full prototype"
- In Ruby, like Java, everything is passed "by reference", but then copies are made by some functions as return values.
